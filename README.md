## Introduction

This project demonstrates how to interface the TMC2209 stepper motor driver with the STM32F767ZI microcontroller. It provides an example of initializing the hardware, configuring the driver settings, and performing basic motor control operations. You can use this project as a starting point for more advanced stepper motor control applications.

## Hardware Requirements

To use this project, you will need the following hardware components:

- STM32F767ZI microcontroller development board
- TMC2209 stepper motor driver
- Stepper motor compatible with the TMC2209 driver
- Appropriate power supply for the motor and driver

## Software Requirements

This project is set up to be developed using the Eclipse IDE with a Makefile-based build system. You will need the following software tools:

- Eclipse IDE with C/C++ development support
- GNU Make build tool
- Any additional libraries or dependencies required by your specific project setup

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository to your local development environment.
2. Open the project in Eclipse IDE.
3. Use STM32CubeMX to configure the necessary peripherals and generate initialization code.
4. Replace placeholder code with your own motor control logic and settings.
5. Build the project using the provided Makefile.
6. Flash the program to your STM32F767ZI board using your preferred IDE or flashing tool.

## Usage

After flashing the program to your STM32F767ZI board, you can observe the motor's behavior as controlled by the code in the project. Use this project as a foundation to explore and implement advanced motor control features, such as microstepping, velocity control, and position control, specific to the TMC2209 driver.
